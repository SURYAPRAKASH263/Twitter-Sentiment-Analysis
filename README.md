### Twitter Sentiment Analysis 
This project analyzes tweets to determine their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The system fetches tweets using the Twitter API, preprocesses the text (removing noise like hashtags, URLs, and special characters), and classifies the sentiment using machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model can be trained using datasets like Sentiment140 and deployed to predict real-time sentiment trends.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Version Control: Use GitHub/GitLab for code management.
Continuous Integration:
Automated testing (e.g., unit tests for preprocessing, model validation).
Static code analysis using tools like SonarQube.
Build Process:
Create a Docker image with the application and dependencies.
Use Docker Compose to manage multi-service setups.
Continuous Deployment:
Deploy the application to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP using Kubernetes or container orchestration tools.
Use CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI for deployment automation.
